  <p>
    Group theory, a branch of algebra, analyzes situations like rotations of the wheel very closely. In terms of group-theoretic notation, Burnside's Lemma asserts the following:
</p>
<p>$$|X/G|=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|X^g|.$$</p>
<p>
  What does all this nonsense mean? It helps to first define the notion of a group. In mathematical terms, a <i>group</i> is a collection of objects $G$, together with an associative binary operation $\cdot$ called multiplication, such that the following properties hold:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>(Closure) For all $a,b\in G$, $a\cdot b\in G$. From now on, we will abbreviate $a\cdot b$ as $ab$.</li>
  <li>(Identity) There is a unique element $e\in G$ such that $ae=ea=a$ for all $a\in G$.</li>
  <li>(Inverse) For each $a\in G$, there is a unique $a^{-1}\in G$ such that $aa^{-1}=a^{-1}a=e$.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to notice that $ab\neq ba$ in an arbitrary group! Commutativity is not a requirement of a group, and we will not assume this is true. A group that is commutative is called <i>Abelian</i>, after Niels Henrik Abel.
<p>
  What use, then, could a group possibly be in the context of rotating wheels? It turns out that groups are useful in a way called a <i>group action</i>. A group action of  a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a function $f: G\times X\rightarrow X$ such that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>(Identity) $f(e,x)=x$, and</li>
<li>(Associativity) $f(gh,x)=f(g,f(h,x))$.</li>
</ol>
<p>We generally abbreviate $f(a,x)$ as simply $ax$. This is a slight abuse of notation, as $x$ is not a member of $G$; nevertheless, this is the common way of writing group actions. Under this new abbreviation, the previous two axioms become $ex=x$ and $(gh)x=g(hx)$, which suddenly seem like very reasonable axioms.
</p>
<p>So we have this definition. What, then, does this this entail? Seeing that a group action is basically a way of assigning each element in a set to another element based on a given element of a group, we can essentially think of the elements of the group as functions. Using this notion, we can easily define some more notation. Define the <i>orbit</i> of an element $x$ with respect to a corresponding group action as the set of elements in $X$ to which $x$ can be mapped to through the group action. Denote this orbit by $\text{Orb}(x)$. Note that if $y\in\text{Orb}(x)$, then $\text{Orb}(y)=\text{Orb}(x)$. To see why this is true, consider an element of $\text{Orb}(y)$. This can be expressed in the form $gy$ by definition. However, since $y\in\text{Orb}(x)$, we know that $y=hx$. Therefore $gy=ghx$, from which we can conclude that $\text{Orb}(y)\subseteq\text{Orb}(x)$. Similarly, suppose that an element in $\text{Orb}(x)$ is $gx$. Observe now that $y=hx\implies x=h^{-1}y$. Therefore we see that $gx=gh^{-1}y$, from which we can conclude that $\text{Orb}(x)\subseteq\text{Orb}(y)$. Thus $\text{Orb}(y)=\text{Orb}(x)$.
</p>
<p>This observation allows us to partition $X$ into distinct orbits, where each set is an orbit of the group action. Denote by $X/G$ the set of all orbits of the group action of $G$ on $X$. This leads us to the first major conclusion: <b>$|X/G|$ represents the number of "distinct" elements of $X$, under the group action of $G$.</b> In the case of our wheels, the set $X$ represents all possible wheels we can create using the given colors regardless of rotation, the group $G$ represents the rotations on the wheel, and $|X/G|$ represents the number of different wheels possible when we take rotations into account.
</p>
<p>Let us make one more definition: denote by $X^g$ the set of elements of $X$ fixed by $g\in G$. Equivalently, $X^g=\{x\in X\mid gx=x\}$. We then have a (more or less) complete mathematical understanding of Burnside's Lemma. Let's see how this can be applied to the problem at hand.
